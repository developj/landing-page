## ðŸš€ Quickstart (Yarn)

```bash
# 1) Install deps
yarn

# 2) Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
yarn dev

# 3) Type-check & build
yarn build

# 4) Preview production build
yarn preview

## End-to-end tests (Playwright)

The config reads BASE_URL and falls back to http://localhost:5173.

Run dev server in one terminal:

yarn dev

# Install browsers (first time / CI)
yarn playwright install --with-deps

# Headless run
yarn test:e2e

# Headed run
yarn test:e2e:headed

# Debug mode (inspector)
yarn test:e2e:debug

# UI mode
yarn test:e2e:ui

# Show last HTML report
yarn test:e2e:report

## No Test library was found, I installed playwright for tests
